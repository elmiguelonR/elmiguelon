### **Contributions**

### **1\. Contribution Workflow**

To maintain a structured and efficient workflow, the team will follow these contribution guidelines:

* **Task Assignments**: Tasks will be assigned based on expertise and availability. We will use a shared task board on Slack to track progress.  
* **Branching Strategy**: Each feature (functions and unit tests) should be worked on in a separate branch.  
* **Code Reviews**: Before merging any changes to the main branch, another team member must review the code.  
* **Commit Messages**: Use clear and concise commit messages following a convention.  
* **Documentation**: Ensure all new functions and features are well-documented(e.g using Roxygen skeleton), including usage examples where applicable.

### **2\. Communication & Meetings**

* Weekly team meetings to discuss progress and resolve roadblocks.  
* Frequent communication via Slack for quick updates.  
* Meeting notes will be documented and shared with the team.

### **3\. Acknowledging Contributions**

* Contributions will be recognized through commits, and pull requests.

By following these guidelines, we ensure a smooth and productive workflow, leading to a successful project outcome.
